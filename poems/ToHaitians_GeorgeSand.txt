Live, breathe, believe, 
You are not forgotten, 
You are not alone.

Your world has crumbled, 
Your loved ones are gone, 
But Hope is not dead

I know it's tough, 
I'll share your pain, 
We'll mourn your loss

Your life is your gain, 
God is not lost, 
Your spirit remains

His priority first, 
Remember it's a test
Of your faith

And again -
You're not alone, 
Be strong, be brave 

Scream if you'd like, 
I will listen 
And together we'll pray

We can get through this, 
You have me. We have God.
You are loved

Take my hand
Feel my heart.
Stay alive. You will prosper again.
