Nature is all we see,
All we want, all we love.
All we know, all we believe in,
All we feel within ourself.

It is beautiful for whom sees it,
It is kind for whom loves it,
It is just when we believe in it,
And when we respect it within ourself.

Look at the sky, it sees you,
Embrace Earth, it loves you.
Truth is what we believe in
In nature, it is thyself.
